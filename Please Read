# bitchalilliana
 what bitchalilliana stands for/is to get out all your anger about who ever you want it to be
 Such as:
 the person you DISLIKE the most
 the person who doesn't do what i
 s asked of them or more like told what to do and never do it
 people who disrespect  you
 people who want to fight you or who fight you
 people who are annoying
 people that bully you
 people that dislike you
 people who are very rude to your family
 The list goes on forever but what won't last long is your heart. And what i mean is that the more you hold in 
 your emotions the more it is going to hurt and cause stress on your heart.
 so please let out all your angry or better yet let it all out and i will not jugde for what shuld be let loose
 it is your choice no one else's, so i hope you choose to let out your emotions in a GOOD way but also in
 a way that will help you and heart grow stronger.
